# wiki-clustering

In this assignment you will implement the k-means algorithm in the specific setting of clustering text documents, but the algorithm is general to any setting. When properly executed, clustering uncovers valuable insights from a set of unlabeled documents. The assignment uses the numpy library for manipulating the data arrays. See this tutorial for more information on numpy.

In this assignment, you will practice:

Cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means
Explore the role of random initialization on the quality of the clustering
Explore how results differ after changing the number of clusters
Evaluate clustering, both quantitatively and qualitatively
